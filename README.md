Hello there, this is Niel, I'm a smart contract developer with experience in Solidity, Motoko and ReactJS 👨🏻‍💻

I'm currently working on building my stack coming up with different ideas and building them 🧱

I have proficiency and experience developing Solidity Smart Contracts for Ethereum-based chains, including all kinds of token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155)

Big believer in blockchain technology 👀 

The applications I build are mostly centered around DeFi and GameFi. I will happily collaborate on any DeFi project for any EVM or ICP 💻
