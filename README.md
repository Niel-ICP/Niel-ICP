Hello there, this is Daniel, I'm a smart contract developer with experience in Solidity, Motoko and ReactJS 👨🏻‍💻

I'm currently working on building my stack coming up with different ideas and building them 🧱

Being a big believer in blockchain technology, I am focused primarily on Motoko and ICP, due to how advanced the tech behind it is, when compared to other chains 👀 

The applications I build are mostly centered around DeFi and GameFi. I will happily collaborate on any DeFi project for any EVM or ICP 💻

Contact me through discord @niel.icp#5299 📫
