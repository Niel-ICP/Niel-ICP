Hello there, this is Niel-ICP, I'm a smart contract developer with experience in Solidity and Motoko 👨🏻‍💻

I'm currently working on building my stack coming up with different ideas and building them 🧱

I am focused primarily on Motoko and ICP and can build functional front-ends. Still learning how to build them pretty, though 👀 

The applications I build are mostly centered around DeFi and GameFi. I will happily collaborate on any DeFi project for any EVM or ICP 💻

Contact me through discord @niel.icp#5299 📫
