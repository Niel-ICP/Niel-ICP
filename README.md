Hello there, this is Niel, I'm a smart contract developer with experience in Solidity and Motoko 👨🏻‍💻

I'm currently working on building my stack coming up with different ideas and building them 🧱

Being a big believer in blockchain technology, I am focused primarily on Motoko and ICP, due to how much more advanced the tech behind it is 👀 

The applications I build are mostly centered around DeFi and GameFi. I will happily collaborate on any DeFi project for any EVM or ICP 💻

Contact me through discord @niel.icp#5299 📫
